Welcome! I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Political Science at Columbia University and Nonresident Fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Cyber Statecraft Initiative.

My research aims to understand the dynamics of conflict in cyberspace and how states such as North Korea leverage cyber capabilities to achieve strategic goals. I am also interested in how emerging technologies shape dynamics in international security.

My current project explores the conditions under which cyber coercion works, using methods such as formal models and lab experiments. In particular, I examine why ransomware has been often successful at coercing victims, despite existing assessments that cyber coercion is difficult to achieve. 

In other ongoing projects, I explore the determinants of stability and instability in cyberspace with a focus on the implications of the U.S. cyber strategy of Defend Forward. I also explore whether and how states can achieve mutual restraint in cyberspace.

I am a co-author of the 2015 book [North Korea’s Cyber Operations: Strategy and Responses](https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/legacy_files/files/publication/151216_Cha_NorthKoreasCyberOperations_Web.pdf) published by Rowman & Littlefield. My research has been funded by the Smith Richardson Foundation. I provide frequent commentary on North Korea’s cyber capabilities and operations.

I received my MA from Georgetown University’s Security Studies Program, and BS in International Politics from Georgetown University’s School of Foreign Service.
